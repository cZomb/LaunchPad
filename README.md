# Html/css/javascript startup page for web browsers

Just a smallish project to practice learning html/css/javascript

Will be writing smaller javascript apps to link in the right column over the next few weeks

## Installation

Just copy the files into a directory and open main.html in your webbrowser

## Usage/Controls

Left column is for common links to websites <br />

center text field and iframe are used for opening local files or embedding websites </br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -for local files, type the file address from your machine <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; -for websites, type the full web address http://www.example.com <br />

Right column will link to javascript applications such as a calender, calculator, etcetc <br />

## Roadmap

Currently working on adding a calendar web app and calculator web app written in javascript <br />
Will be working on fixing some scaling issues with element positioning and sizing when zooming in or out <br />
